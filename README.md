DeepXDE is a deep learning library for solving differential equations on top of [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

Use DeepXDE if you need a deep learning library that

- solves partial differential equations (PDEs),
- solves integro-differential equations (IDEs),
- solves fractional partial differential equations (fPDEs),
- solves inverse problems for differential equations,
- approximates functions from a dataset with/without constraints,
- approximates functions from multi-fidelity data,
- approximates operators.

DeepXDE is extensible to solve other problems in Scientific Machine Learning.

**Papers**

- DeepXDE: [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04502)
- Multi-fidelity neural network: [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00104)
- Deep operator network (DeepONet): [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03193)

## Features

DeepXDE supports

- complex domain geometries without tyranny mesh generation. The primitive geometries are interval, triangle, rectangle, polygon, disk, cuboid, and sphere. Other geometries can be constructed as constructive solid geometry (CSG) using three boolean operations: union, difference, and intersection;
- multi-physics, i.e., coupled PDEs;
- 5 types of boundary conditions (BCs): Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, periodic, and a general BC;
- time-dependent PDEs are solved as easily as time-independent ones by only adding initial conditions;
- residual-based adaptive refinement (RAR);
- uncertainty quantification using dropout;
- two types of neural networks: fully connected neural network, and residual neural network;
- many different losses, metrics, optimizers, learning rate schedules, initializations, regularizations, etc.;
- useful techniques, such as dropout and batch normalization;
- callbacks to monitor the internal states and statistics of the model during training;
- enables the user code to be compact, resembling closely the mathematical formulation.

All the components of DeepXDE are loosely coupled, and thus DeepXDE is well-structured and highly configurable. It is easy to customize DeepXDE to meet new demands.

## Installation

DeepXDE requires [TensorFlow 1](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to be installed.
(Sorry, but DeepXDE does not support TensorFlow 2 yet.)
Then, you can install DeepXDE itself.

- Install the stable version with `pip`:

```
$ pip install deepxde
```

- Install the stable version with `conda`:

```
$ conda install -c conda-forge deepxde
```

- For developers, you should clone the folder to your local machine and put it along with your project scripts.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/lululxvi/deepxde.git
```

- Dependencies

    - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
    - [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
    - [SALib](http://salib.github.io/SALib/)
    - [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org)
    - [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
    - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
